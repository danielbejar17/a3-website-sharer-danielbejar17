## Deployed Website URL
https://a2-website-sharer-danielbejar17-2.onrender.com/

## Additional Info Displayed in Previewer
The previewer now extracts **og:site_name** from webpages to display the website name above the title
Example URL to see it work: http://ischool.uw.edu

## Visual Style Changes
Styled the preview as a card with a border, rounded corners, padding, centered content, and a pale blue background (#e6f0ff). This groups all preview information together

## Creative Component / Improvement
- Added extraction of `og:site_name` to provide extra context about the webpage.
- Centered the text and images, and made the site name smaller and gray for readability.
- The styling improves clarity and user experience by making each preview visually distinct and easy to scan

## Collaboration
No other students helped me directly with my code
